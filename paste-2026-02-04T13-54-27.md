## Overview: Microsoft License.rtf in MSI Installers

Microsoft **license.rtf** files are the Rich Text Format documents shown as End-User License Agreements (EULAs) during software installation. They contain the **“Microsoft Software License Terms”** for the specific product and are formatted with section headings, numbering, and bold text for key titles. Typically, each license.rtf starts by naming the product and stating that **“these license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft”** and that using the software implies acceptance. The content covers installation/use rights, any redistribution permissions, scope of the license, data collection, disclaimers, and other legal clauses, following Microsoft’s standard structure. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)

For the XTS installer, a suitable approach is to reuse or adapt a license.rtf from a comparable Microsoft developer tool. An excellent candidate is the license.rtf from **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, since XTS appears to be a similar internal tooling project. The SSMS license terms align with Microsoft’s practices and formatting, and they can serve as a **base template**. Below, we examine the SSMS license.rtf and compare it with another example (Azure Data Studio’s license terms) to highlight structure, content, and notable differences.

## Example 1: SSMS License.rtf (SQL Server Management Studio)

**Source Project:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – a Microsoft developer tool for SQL Server management.  
**License Type:** **Microsoft Software License Terms** (proprietary EULA for a Microsoft product).  
**Formatting Style:** Structured as a numbered list of sections with **bold section titles** and some ALL-CAPS headings. For example, Section 1 is *“INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS”* (bold) describing usage permissions. The document title explicitly includes the product name (**“MICROSOFT SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO”**) in bold at the top, reinforcing branding. The text is in paragraph form with typical legal language; formatting is kept simple (no logos or images, just text with bold/underline as needed for headings). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)

**Content & Notable Clauses:** The SSMS license.rtf covers standard EULA points:

-   **Installation and Use Rights:** Allows installing and using any number of copies for development/test. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Distributable Code:** *This is a notable inclusion in SSMS’s license.* It explicitly grants rights to redistribute certain code/components that come with SSMS (like samples or templates) under specific conditions. It lists **Distribution Rights**, **Distribution Requirements**, and **Distribution Restrictions** in sub-paragraphs. This section is tailored for developer tools, letting users include bits of SSMS libraries or sample code in their own apps, provided they add “significant primary functionality” and protect Microsoft’s rights. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms) [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Scope of License:** Clarifies that the software is licensed, not sold, and enumerates things the user **cannot** do (e.g. no reverse engineering, no circumventing technical limits, etc.). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Data Collection:** Explains that the software may collect usage data and links consent to Microsoft’s privacy statement. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Export Restrictions:** Requires compliance with export laws. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **No Warranty & Liability Limitations:** Disclaims warranties (“as-is” software) and limits damages to $5 USD maximum, excluding indirect damages. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Applicable Law & Consumer Rights:** Indicates which law governs the license and notes regional consumer-law variations (e.g. specific statements for Australia, Canada, EU countries). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Support/Updates:** States Microsoft isn’t obligated to support, and that the software may auto-update. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)

**Branding Elements:** The SSMS license explicitly names Microsoft and the product. It uses Microsoft’s standard legal phrasing (e.g. referring to Microsoft Corporation or affiliates, and including boilerplate clauses). It **does not** usually include a full copyright notice or trademark list within the RTF itself – instead, it’s understood as part of the Microsoft Software License Terms. The tone is formal and legally precise.

This SSMS license.rtf is a good baseline because XTS, being an internal tool likely distributed to users, would also require users to accept similar terms. It ensures all necessary Microsoft legal protections (liability limits, no warranty, etc.) are in place and uses a familiar format that Microsoft’s installers already handle.

## Example 2: Azure Data Studio License Terms (Comparison)

**Source Project:** Azure Data Studio (ADS) – a cross-platform data tool.  
**License Type:** Microsoft Software License Terms (EULA) **with open-source component notes**. (Azure Data Studio’s core is based on Visual Studio Code, so its license terms include references to MIT-licensed code).  
**Formatting Style:** Very similar structure (numbered sections, bold headings) to SSMS’s license. It begins with the product name (**“Microsoft Azure Data Studio”**) and standard intro text. The RTF formatting is the same style (though on Microsoft Learn it’s shown as HTML, the installer includes an RTF). Key section titles are bold (e.g. “INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS,” “DATA,” “SCOPE OF LICENSE,” etc.). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license) [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)

**Content & Notable Clauses:** Azure Data Studio’s license covers much of the same ground with a few differences reflecting its open-source aspects:

-   **Installation and Use:** Similar unlimited installation for development use. **Demo use** is explicitly allowed (showing the software in demonstrations). It also explicitly mentions **Third-Party Components** and **Extensions** – acknowledging that ADS can load extensions from a marketplace, which are governed by their own licenses. (This clause isn’t in SSMS, since SSMS doesn’t have the same extension model). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)
-   **Data Collection:** Present, with a note that documentation (on GitHub wiki) explains telemetry and opt-out options (slightly different wording but purpose akin to SSMS’s data clause). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)
-   **Updates & Feedback:** ADS license has a separate section on **Updates** (automatic updates and the user’s consent to them) and on **Feedback** (giving Microsoft rights to use any feedback provided). SSMS’s license, in contrast, folded updates into a clause but did not explicitly mention feedback. The feedback clause is a common Microsoft addition in newer developer tool EULAs, ensuring any user suggestions can be used freely. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)
-   **Scope of License:** Notably, the ADS license clarifies the open-source piece: it states the license applies to “Azure Data Studio **Code**” and notes *“Source code for Azure Data Studio is available under the MIT license”* with a GitHub link. This is a **major difference in content**: SSMS is fully Microsoft-proprietary, so no such statement is needed. In ADS, this clause essentially says parts of the product are MIT licensed, but the packaged product as a whole is under Microsoft’s terms. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)
-   **No Warranty, Liability Limit, Applicable Law:** These appear and serve the same function as in SSMS’s license (worded in the standard way about “as-is” and $5 liability cap). ADS’s text is virtually identical in these sections. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)
-   **Regional Variations:** Also included, similarly to SSMS, covering Australia, Canada, Germany/Austria, etc., to comply with local laws. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)

**Branding Elements:** The ADS license is also titled “Microsoft Software License Terms” and includes Microsoft’s name and the product name in the intro, maintaining the corporate identity. It also references Microsoft’s privacy statement and links (just as SSMS’s does, though ADS provides a specific URL for telemetry info). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)

**Summary of Differences:** The table below summarizes key attributes of the two examples:

| **License.rtf Source** | **Project & Type** | **Formatting Style** | **Notable Clauses & Focus** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)** | Microsoft internal product; closed-source EULA [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms) | Standard MS EULA formatting: numbered sections, bold headings [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms); product name in title [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms). | *Distributable Code* section granting rights to ship certain SSMS components [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms). No mention of extensions. Classic clauses on use, scope, data, warranty, liability [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms). Tailored for a pure Microsoft product. |
| **Azure Data Studio** | Hybrid (MS product with MIT core) EULA [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license) | Similar format (bold section titles, numbered lists) [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). Product name and MS intro present [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). | Mentions third-party extensions and components explicitly [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). Acknowledges MIT-licensed source code in scope [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). Has **Feedback** clause [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). Otherwise includes standard MS terms (data, no warranty, $5 liability cap, etc.) [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license). |

**Insights:** Both files use essentially the same template structure, ensuring consistency with Microsoft’s licensing standards. SSMS’s license.rtf is a **prototypical example for an installer EULA** – it’s likely very similar to what XTS would need, given XTS is also an internal tool using Microsoft libraries. Azure Data Studio’s example shows how the template can be adjusted to special cases (like including open-source notices or extension ecosystems), which provides a sense of flexibility if XTS has unique aspects (for instance, if XTS includes third-party components, one might incorporate similar notices into the license text).

[\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)

## Conclusion and Recommendation

For the XTS MSI installer, **using the SSMS license.rtf as a starting point is highly recommended**. SSMS’s license file exemplifies Microsoft’s standard format and content for installer EULAs, which means it already aligns with corporate requirements. You should obtain the SSMS license.rtf (English version and any needed localized versions) and use it as a base – replacing the product name with XTS and updating any sections that need adjustment for XTS’s scenario. For example, if XTS includes any third-party libraries or has usage limitations beyond standard ones, update the text or add a clause (taking cues from how Azure Data Studio’s license notes third-party components). [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/license)

By adopting this base:

-   **Formatting and style** will meet Microsoft standards (important for the MSI to display it properly in the UI).
-   **Legal coverage** will be thorough – all the necessary protections for Microsoft and notices to the user are in place. [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms), [\[learn.microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/sql/sql-server-management-studio-license-terms)
-   **Clarity for end users** is ensured, as they will see a familiar format and wording used across Microsoft products.

In summary, **SSMS’s license.rtf provides a solid template** that likely only needs minor edits for XTS. Comparing it with other internal tool licenses (like Azure Data Studio’s) shows that any unique XTS requirements (like mentioning specific open-source components or services) can be integrated without deviating from the core structure. This approach ensures your MSI installer includes a professional, compliant license agreement file that aligns with Microsoft’s licensing practices and branding.
