# Rollout Plan for XTS VS Code Extension (OneBox Pilot → SAW → NC/AGC)

## Rollout Overview & Key Milestones

The **XTS** VS Code extension will be introduced in multiple **phases** to ensure stability and user adoption. The plan is to start with a **limited pilot** on the **OneBox** environment in **February–March 2026**, expand to the **Secure Admin Workstation (SAW)** environment for a broader internal release by **May 2026**, and then extend to **National Cloud (NC)** and **Air Gapped Cloud (AGC)** environments in the following months. This phased rollout allows the team to validate functionality and address issues early before impacting all environments. [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Key Milestones:**

-   **OneBox Pilot (Feb–Mar 2026):** Deploy the extension to a small group of **DRI** (Distributed Responsible Individual) users in the OneBox test environment. The goal is to **verify core functionalities** of XTS within VS Code (e.g. rendering XTS views, running CAS commands, Kusto queries) and collect initial feedback on performance and usability. This pilot will confirm that top-priority support tasks during incidents can be handled effectively with the extension. **Success criteria:** resolve any critical bugs, ensure the extension covers the main XTS use cases, and demonstrate that incident response times are not negatively impacted. Early pilot feedback will drive refinements before wider release.
    
-   **SAW Deployment (Apr–May 2026):** Once validated in OneBox, the extension will be packaged for **enterprise-wide deployment on SAW** (the highly secured on-call engineer environment). The target is a **May 2026** rollout on SAW. Leading up to this, the team will work with the SAW engineering/IT admin team to publish the extension via the official **Software Center** (or analogous distribution mechanism) to all on-call engineers’ SAW machines. Key activities include obtaining security approvals, finalizing the **installer/extension package** (with code signing as needed), and verifying that the extension adheres to SAW policies (for example, ensuring no prohibited services are running and all network calls are allow-listed). A **soft launch** to an *Early Adopters* group may precede the full SAW deployment to do a final validation under real-world conditions. **Success criteria:** successful installation on SAW without blocking issues, positive feedback from early users, and no increase in incident mitigation times or failure rates.

-   **Broader Rollout to NC & AGC (H2 2026):** After proving the extension in the main corporate environment, the next step is to bring it to **sovereign clouds** – the National Cloud and Air-Gapped Cloud. These environments have additional restrictions (e.g. limited or no internet connectivity, stricter compliance rules) that must be addressed. The plan is to coordinate with the teams managing these clouds to integrate the VS Code extension into their software distribution pipelines. Notably, past SQL tool releases have leveraged **DSConsole deployment scripts** to propagate new tool versions to NC/AGC automatically. By late 2025 the Livesite Tools team had already added support for new VMSS jumpboxes in **Mooncake (China National Cloud)** and implemented blacklisting/auto-update mechanisms for **AGC** – these mechanisms will be leveraged for the extension as well. **Key tasks** in this phase include testing the extension in NC/AGC to ensure it works offline or with minimal dependencies, creating any needed offline installers or **Sovereign Cloud pipelines**, and aligning with security teams for **compliance approvals** (e.g. confirming that the extension’s telemetry and any AI integration meet data handling rules). The timeline is tentatively set for the **second half of 2026** (exact timing to be refined based on SAW rollout outcomes). A successful NC/AGC rollout will mean on-call engineers in those isolated clouds have the same VS Code-based tooling experience as public cloud engineers, achieving full **parity across all environments**.

-   **Post-Rollout & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing):** Even after the extension is deployed in all environments, the work continues. The team will monitor usage and incident metrics to ensure the extension is delivering on its promise (e.g. tracking how frequently DRIs use the VS Code extension vs legacy XTS tool for incident response). Regular **feedback loops** will be established – through surveys, **Teams channels**, and post-incident debriefs – to gather user input and identify pain points or missing features. The goal is to iterate rapidly: the **Livesite Tools team** has been moving toward shorter release cycles (from quarterly to monthly releases), so we plan to deliver frequent updates to address issues, improve performance, and add remaining features (like **view authoring, Service Fabric Explorer (SFE) integration, or other tooling**). We will also define **success metrics** (e.g. percentage of DRIs adopting the extension, reduction in tool-switching during incidents, incident resolution time improvements) and track them. Eventually, once the extension is fully matured and trusted, a plan to **sunset the old XTS desktop tool** can be executed, consolidating all users on the new platform.

## Dependencies and Risk Mitigation

Rolling out an internal tool in high-stakes environments (like on-call incident response) requires careful management of **dependencies** and **risks**:

-   **SAW Environment Compliance:** *Dependency:* The extension must meet all SAW security and deployment requirements. This means **packaging via the official Software Center** and obtaining any necessary security reviews or exceptions. For example, the extension may need a local **MCP server** (Model Composition Service for Copilot/AI features) which is typically restricted on SAW; the team will work with SAW engineering to enable this without violating policies. *Mitigation:* Early engagement with the SAW platform team to ensure the extension is signed, scanned, and approved for SAW. We will also run additional security testing (penetration testing, compliance checks) to avoid last-minute surprises. [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    
-   **Authentication & Data Handling:** *Dependency:* The extension’s integration with internal services (XTS backend, CAS API, Kusto, etc.) must use secure authentication (likely Azure AD/Managed Identity or similar) that functions on SAW and in disconnected environments. Moreover, any AI/ML features (e.g. GitHub Copilot integration or “Bluebird” internal Copilot service) must not expose sensitive customer data to external LLMs. *Mitigation:* Work with security and privacy teams to implement proper **anonymization or opt-out controls** for any data sent to AI services. All data interactions will be reviewed for compliance. The extension will honor the **data handling policies** in these environments, potentially disabling or restricting AI features in NC/AGC if required by policy. [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    
-   **“Bluebird” Service Availability:** *Dependency:* The internal AI assistant (Bluebird/Copilot) needs to be available in SAW to fully realize the extension’s Copilot features. As of Jan 2026, Bluebird was a few months away from being **SAW-ready**. *Mitigation:* The rollout timeline already accounts for this – by targeting May 2026 for SAW, we expect Bluebird to be deployed in SAW by then. If it’s not ready, the extension’s AI features will be turned off on SAW initially, with an update to enable them once Bluebird is live. Copilot Chat in VS Code can technically be enabled in a limited way even before full support (as noted in internal tests), but official support will wait for the proper backend. [\[Re: SQL DR...extension | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADZkMzYzNzkzLTQwZjItNDEzMC04MjMxLTc5MWY3ODEzMGJmZgBGAAAAAABEixQZuPpZQp2HuhHIrosNBwA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAAJgcfgoAAA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAASHlZCtAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
    
-   **Performance and Stability:** *Risk:* During incidents, speed and reliability are paramount. The extension must not degrade the DRI’s ability to respond quickly. Past testing indicates XTS (even when used via the extension’s CLI mode) could consume large memory (7–8 GB) on SAW machines, and VS Code itself has a memory footprint. There’s a risk the extension could be seen as slow or heavy, causing frustration. *Mitigation:* Optimize the extension to call services directly instead of running heavy background modules. For instance, one improvement under discussion is calling **CAS APIs directly** instead of loading large PowerShell modules, which should reduce memory usage. The pilot phase will specifically monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and performance of key scenarios (loading an XTS dashboard, running a complex CMS query, etc.) to catch any issues. We will set performance targets (e.g. loading an XTS view in VS Code should be as fast as or faster than in the legacy XTS client) and address any bottlenecks found in testing.

-   **User Adoption & Change Management:** *Risk:* On-call engineers may be hesitant to switch to a new tool during high-pressure incidents, especially if they perceive any functionality gaps. There’s also the challenge of potentially **maintaining two sets of tools** (the VS Code extension and the legacy XTS/SFE/DSC tools) during the transition. *Mitigation:* **Gradual rollout** is itself a mitigation – by starting with a pilot and then an opt-in early adoption phase on SAW, we ensure only motivated users try it first, and their success stories can then encourage others. We will clearly communicate that the extension’s purpose is to *unify* and eventually replace older tools, reducing overall complexity. During the transition, both the old and new tools will be available; users can fall back to the legacy tools if needed. We will also identify a set of **“champion” users** in each region or team – likely those who participated in the pilot – to act as points of contact for questions and to help train colleagues. Their positive feedback and tips can be shared in communications (e.g. in the newsletter or team meetings) to build confidence. Finally, we will only plan the final deprecation of the old tools when the extension has proven fully reliable and all critical features are in place, to avoid leaving gaps.

-   **Tool Parity in NC/AGC:** *Risk:* The NC and AGC environments often lag in tool availability or have unique constraints (e.g. lack of internet connectivity for extensions, stricter network rules). Rolling out to these environments might face unexpected issues or delays. *Mitigation:* Treat NC/AGC rollout as a separate project phase with dedicated testing. Leverage the **existing distribution mechanisms** for sovereign clouds – for example, Livesite Tools releases already use automated **installer scripts and pipelines for sovereign clouds**. We will coordinate with the **DS Console team** (who manage tool deployment in those clouds) to include the VS Code extension in the next scheduled NC/AGC tools update. Prior to that, test the extension on actual NC/AGC jumpboxes (ensuring that all dependencies are either included offline or accessible within those networks). Also, add specific **configuration flags** in the extension to accommodate offline mode (for instance, disabling auto-update checks or external calls in AGC). Close partnership with the **Sovereign Cloud support teams** will ensure we meet any additional certification needed. We recognize that NC/AGC users often receive updates later, so we will time the rollout to follow the SAW release by a couple of months, giving us time to resolve issues from the SAW deployment first.

-   **Rollback Plan:** *Risk:* In case a severe issue emerges (e.g. the extension causes an incident delay or has a security flaw), we must be ready to roll back. *Mitigation:* The Livesite Tools team has an established practice of **blacklisting problematic tool versions and rolling back if needed**. We will prepare a **contingency plan**: if necessary, the extension can be disabled/removed via the same Software Center mechanism or by a quick update that turns off its features. DRIs will always have the legacy tools (XTS, etc.) installed as a backup. Clear communication will be sent immediately if such a rollback is invoked, with instructions to ensure engineers switch back to the previous tools. Additionally, the pilot and staggered rollout approach reduces the likelihood of a large-scale issue; any show-stoppers should surface during earlier phases when fewer users are affected.

## Lessons from Similar SQL Org Rollouts

**Internal best practices and lessons learned** from prior SQL organization rollouts will heavily inform this plan:

-   **Use Pilots and Early Adopters:** The SQL team has a history of rolling out new tools in stages. For example, during the transition of all Livesite tools to the new Microsoft Production Desktop (MPD) environment, the team first enabled a subset of **OneSQL “Extended” and Early Adopters** before broader rollout. This allowed them to gather real-world feedback and fix issues early. We will mirror this by leveraging a pilot and possibly an early-adopter phase on SAW. A small group of volunteer DRIs and **power users** will be enrolled to provide candid feedback and serve as evangelists for the extension’s benefits. [\[Nov 25, 20...MPD Agent | Loop\]](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnQuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vdGVhbXMvc3Fsc3JlY29yZT9uYXY9Y3owbE1rWjBaV0Z0Y3lVeVJuTnhiSE55WldOdmNtVW1aRDFpSlRJeEpUVkdXVFpPYjFaMFRqQkZiVGcyVVdsaVNFeFNjRE5GWm5vMFVYSkpORzV3UVd0bWEzUXhVM1VsTWtSUVVucENaVGhvZERKRFdWVlRXbWR1VjJGM05uaHdVRXNtWmowd01WTk1RalZIVWtnMVQxaExWRVpTVlROWFNrUkpVRU16TWpWU1VVMVlSRFJDSm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)
    
-   **Comprehensive Communication & Training:** Clear, proactive communication is critical when changing tools. In previous rollouts, program leaders (like Megha Devaraj and Anuradha Jha) sent out **SQL Livesite Tools newsletters** and announcements highlighting new tool releases and improvements. For this extension, we will coordinate announcements via multiple channels: the regular Livesite Tools newsletter, targeted emails to on-call engineers, and posts in internal Teams channels (e.g. the **SQL Livesite Tools Teams channel**). These communications will **emphasize the timeline and benefits** of the new VS Code extension (e.g. unified interface, access to Copilot, modern tech stack). They will also set expectations (such as “This is initially a preview on OneBox – here’s how to try it and give feedback”). In the MPD migration case, the team explicitly listed tool availability, known issues, and support info in their communications; we will do the same. We’ll prepare **quick-start guides** and update internal wikis/EngHub documentation with usage instructions and troubleshooting tips for the extension.

-   **Support and Feedback Channels:** Prior rollouts underscored the value of robust user support. During the MPD onboarding, **dedicated Teams channels, office hours, and TSGs (troubleshooting guides)** were set up to assist users and answer questions in real-time. We will leverage the existing “SQL Livesite Tools” Teams channel (and possibly create a focused channel for the VS Code extension pilot) where users can ask questions or report issues. Key team members (including the extension’s engineers and experienced pilot users) will monitor these channels, especially during the initial rollout weeks. We will also hold “office hour” sessions around the SAW deployment time – e.g. a weekly drop-in call during the first month – for live Q&A and support. This multi-channel support approach proved crucial in previous cases to drive adoption and quickly resolve user confusion. We will actively **solicit feedback** as well: for instance, adding a feedback prompt in the extension or sending a survey to pilot users. In the MPD transition, the team gathered feedback on the **communication materials** themselves before broad send-out, which is a practice we’ll repeat to ensure our messaging is clear.

-   **Stakeholder Engagement:** Successful rollouts involve aligning stakeholders early. We see that SRE leadership (like Jack Li) was closely involved in Livesite Tools updates and in championing modernization efforts. For our plan, we have buy-in from senior stakeholders (e.g. Jack Li and the SQL SRE leadership team) as this extension is part of the broader “DRI Tools unification” North Star. We will provide regular updates to these stakeholders at key checkpoints (end of pilot, before SAW launch, etc.). Their support helps reinforce the message to teams that this initiative is important. Additionally, we will coordinate with related teams (such as the **Serbia engineering team** who worked on similar VS Code tool prototypes) to incorporate any lessons they learned and avoid duplicate efforts. Engaging the **supportability and IT teams** responsible for NC/AGC deployments early will also smooth the path for the later phases.

-   **Focus on Tool Parity and Critical Features:** Another lesson from prior internal tools is to ensure the new solution covers the must-haves to not impede users. The SQL team’s **“Tools parity”** efforts showed the need to support all clouds and core scenarios (Bleu, Gov, OneBox, etc.) before users fully embrace a tool. In our case, that means ensuring the VS Code extension can accomplish the top 10 XTS scenarios (monitoring dashboards, common queries, etc.) – as also reflected in the modernization plan milestones for integrating XTS, SFE, CAS, etc.. By learning from those milestones, we’ll prioritize any missing capabilities (for example, if view authoring is not ready, we’ll communicate it and plan to add it, so users know it’s coming). This way, engineers aren’t forced to drop back to the old tool for key tasks – a crucial aspect of driving adoption. [\[SQL Engine...- Oct 2025 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5DABFBC6-D5E0-47F0-888A-F9F510950F3A%7D&file=SQL%20Engineering%20Forum%20\(Tooling\)%20-%20Oct%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[One Tool -...Workbench | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE5A791A5-8626-4090-B03B-D1E21074BD83%7D&file=One%20Tool%20-%20SQL%20DRI%20Workbench.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [\[One Tool -...Workbench | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE5A791A5-8626-4090-B03B-D1E21074BD83%7D&file=One%20Tool%20-%20SQL%20DRI%20Workbench.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    
-   **Iterate and Improve Continuously:** Finally, previous rollouts highlight the importance of iteration. The Livesite Tools team adopted a more agile release cadence (monthly releases) to deliver improvements faster. We will similarly take an agile approach: quickly fixing issues discovered in pilot/early use and pushing updates. Our plan includes a “post-release” phase of monitoring and improvement – treating the rollout not as a one-time event but an ongoing program to enhance the extension (with AI suggestions, new integrations, etc.). This continuous improvement mindset, coupled with clear success metrics (e.g. adoption rates, user satisfaction scores), will help keep the tool aligned with engineers’ needs and justify broader investments.

| **Phase 3: NC & AGC Rollout**  
*(Q3 2026)* | – **Adapt extension** for sovereign clouds: disable or modify features that require external access (Copilot/LLM integrations) to comply with data isolation [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)  
– Work with **DS Console release pipeline** to bundle the extension into the standard tool update for NC/AGC (leveraging existing installer scripts) [\[\[NEW\] SQL...ls Release | External\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/Shared Documents/Tooling/Tools Release Docs/[NEW] SQL Livesite Tools Release.docx), [\[\[NEW\] SQL...ls Release | External\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/Shared Documents/Tooling/Tools Release Docs/[NEW] SQL Livesite Tools Release.docx)  
– Perform testing in NC and fully **air-gapped test environment** to validate functionality offline  
– **Announce and deploy** to NC and AGC on a cloud-by-cloud schedule (coordinate with those teams for timing)  
– Provide localized support if needed (e.g. adjustments for China sovereign cloud) and ensure documentation covers any cloud-specific setup | **Tooling Team & DS Console Team** – integrate extension into NC/AGC deployment process (Megha Devaraj, Jonathan Bullkich, etc.) [\[\[NEW\] SQL...ls Release | External\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/Shared Documents/Tooling/Tools Release Docs/[NEW] SQL Livesite Tools Release.docx)  
**NC/AGC Ops Teams** – schedule and execute the rollout in respective cloud environments  
**Security/Compliance** – sign off on any cloud-specific constraints (no telemetry, etc., as required by policy)  
**Local SRE Leads** – communicate to NC/AGC user groups (since these may be different teams) | *Upcoming* – Estimated Q3 2026, after SAW release stabilizes (timeline may adjust based on SAW phase results; aim to complete by end of 2026). |
| **Phase 4: Post-Rollout & Improvement**  
*(Ongoing)* | – **Monitor usage & KPIs**: track adoption rate (# of active extension users, # incidents resolved via extension), performance stats, and gather user satisfaction input  
– Set up **feedback channels**: ongoing office hours, feedback forms, and integrate user suggestions into backlog  
– **Iterative releases**: Move to regular (e.g. monthly) update cadence for bug fixes and new features (e.g. adding **View Authoring, SFE integration** and other tools per modernization roadmap) [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [\[Modernization ideas | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2194BF71-3172-4434-B557-15B0BD997D66%7D&file=Modernization%20ideas.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)  
– **Knowledge sharing**: Continue training new DRIs on the extension (embed in onboarding process, update on-call training materials)  
– Plan decommissioning of legacy tools (XTS, etc.) once extension adoption is nearly universal and all crucial features are in place (likely in 2027) | **XTS Dev Team** – implement enhancements & fixes; respond to feedback quickly  
**Product Owner/PM** – prioritize features based on impact (e.g. adding remaining tools like Kusto, DSC)  
**SRE Org Leads** – review progress against success metrics (adoption, MTTR, etc.) and champion full adoption (e.g. mandate use of new tool when appropriate)  
**All users** – continue to provide feedback and share success stories/best practices | *Ongoing* – Begin right after each phase. Major review at 1–2 months post-SAW to assess if criteria met for broader rollout. Continuous updates thereafter (monthly minor releases; quarterly feature releases). |

**Notes:** This plan is designed to be **adaptive**. Each phase’s outcomes will be evaluated before proceeding to the next. For instance, if the OneBox pilot reveals critical issues, the SAW release may be postponed until those are resolved. Throughout, we will maintain a strong focus on user communication, training, and support, recognizing that tool adoption in an operational environment depends as much on **people factors** as on technology.

The phased approach, combined with lessons learned from similar rollouts, is intended to mitigate risk while introducing a powerful new capability for SQL on-call engineers. By the end of this program, the XTS VS Code extension should be available and embraced across all Microsoft clouds – providing a unified, modern incident management experience for the SQL organization. The result will be a more efficient DRI workflow (as highlighted in our modernization vision) and a foundation for further innovation (like AI-assisted troubleshooting) in the future.

# Rollout Plan for XTS VS Code Extension (OneBox Dev/Test → SAW → NC/AGC)

## Rollout Overview & Key Milestones

The rollout of the **XTS** VS Code extension is structured in **multiple phases** to ensure a smooth and safe deployment. The plan begins with an internal development/testing phase on **OneBox** (Feb–Mar 2026), moves to a broad release on **Secure Admin Workstations (SAW)** by May 2026, and finally expands to the **National Cloud (NC)** and **Air-Gapped Cloud (AGC)** environments later in the year. This phased strategy allows the team to validate functionality in a controlled setting first, then progressively introduce the tool to more critical and restricted environments. Below are the key milestones and their goals:

-   **OneBox Development & Testing (Feb–Mar 2026):** Deploy the extension in a **OneBox** environment – an internal sandbox where engineers can test diagnostics and repair workflows safely, using non-production clusters. This phase is not about on-call DRIs using the tool for live incidents; instead, **tool developers and test engineers** will run through typical support scenarios (like connecting to test clusters, executing XTS views, CMS/Kusto queries, and simulated repair scripts) to ensure the extension performs reliably. The aim is to flush out bugs or environment mismatches early. OneBox often reveals integration issues, yet we recognize its limitations: historically, differences between OneBox and SAW have sometimes led to surprises in production. So, while a successful OneBox test is necessary, additional validation on SAW (with signed builds and real configurations) will follow. **Key outcomes** of this phase include confirming core XTS features work in VS Code, ensuring the extension can authenticate and fetch data correctly, and gathering initial feedback from internal testers. Any critical issues discovered (e.g. connectivity errors, permission problems, UI bugs) will be resolved before proceeding. [\[Onebox and...inner loop | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SQLOneBox/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9CE80B23-98E5-4813-B1EA-E25D15CE0637%7D&file=Onebox%20and%20Livesite%20Tools%20for%20developer%20inner%20loop.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    
-   **SAW Enterprise Release (Apr–May 2026):** After refining the extension from OneBox feedback, the next milestone is deploying it to the **on-call engineering community** via SAW. Targeting **May 2026**, the extension will be packaged and released through the official SAW software distribution channels (e.g. a signed VSIX or MSI delivered via Software Center). Leading up to this, we will coordinate with the SAW platform team to handle **security and compliance reviews** (ensuring the extension meets all SAW policies for network access, authentication, and code signing). Because SAW environments are highly locked-down, we must verify that the extension’s features (especially those involving external services like our internal Copilot/AI integration) function within SAW’s constraints. If necessary, some features will be scoped appropriately (for instance, disabling any telemetry or non-compliant calls on SAW). We may conduct a short **early-adopter trial** on SAW with a subset of users (possibly those who participated in the OneBox testing or volunteers from the DRI community) before the full release, as a final check under real-world conditions. **Success criteria for SAW rollout:** The extension installs and runs on SAW without security issues, on-call DRIs can perform their incident workflows in VS Code (with XTS and related tools) effectively, and initial user feedback is positive (or at least, no major functionality gaps are identified that block usage).
    
-   **National Cloud & AGC Deployment (H2 2026):** Once the extension is proven in the corporate (public cloud) environment, the plan extends to sovereign clouds: the **National Clouds (e.g. Fairfax, Mooncake)** and the **Air-Gapped Cloud**. These environments often require special handling due to stricter network isolation and compliance rules. We anticipate the rollout to these clouds in the latter half of 2026. Key steps include packaging the extension with any necessary modifications for offline use (e.g. bundling dependencies that would normally be fetched online, and disabling features that cannot operate without internet or that don’t meet sovereign cloud data policies). We will collaborate with the **supportability teams for NC/AGC** to integrate the extension into their deployment pipelines. Past rollouts of SQL Livesite tools to NC/AGC used **auto-update scripts and blacklisting** to manage versions in those environments; similarly, our extension will be included in those scripts to ensure administrators can deploy updates and roll back if needed. Before full rollout, the extension will be tested on NC and AGC jumpboxes by designated contacts (e.g. an engineer like Justin Pham has been a partner contact for AGC validations in previous releases). **Goal:** Achieve feature parity and reliability in NC/AGC so that on-call engineers in those clouds have the same capabilities in VS Code as their peers in the public cloud, fulfilling the organization’s parity objective for livesite tooling across all environments.
    
-   **Post-Deployment & Improvement (Ongoing):** After the initial deployments, the focus shifts to **monitoring, support, and continuous improvement**. Key activities will include tracking usage metrics (how many DRIs adopt the extension, how frequently it’s used during incidents, impact on MTTR), collecting feedback through surveys and the dedicated support channels, and issuing regular updates. The Livesite Tools team has been moving to a faster **monthly release cadence**, which we will leverage for this extension: quick turnarounds on bug fixes and introduction of new features (for example, adding **view authoring** or deeper integration with Service Fabric Explorer if those weren’t in the initial release). The ultimate long-term milestone, beyond 2026, could be the **deprecation of legacy tools** like the standalone XTS application once the VS Code extension is fully adopted and trusted. User feedback and adoption rates will guide that decision, ensuring we only phase out old tools when the new experience comprehensively covers all needs and proves its superiority (a lesson learned from past tool migrations).
    

## Dependencies and Risk Mitigation

Rolling out an internal tool in mission-critical environments entails various **dependencies** that must be managed and **risks** to mitigate:

-   **Environment Compatibility & Parity:** A top dependency is ensuring the extension works consistently across OneBox, SAW, and sovereign clouds. The program’s goals explicitly include 100% parity of tools in **SAW, OneBox, NC, and new clouds**. We know from experience that differences between OneBox (a local test environment) and the locked-down SAW environment can cause issues that only appear in production. *Mitigation:* Conduct thorough testing on SAW with signed builds prior to the full release (in addition to OneBox testing) to catch environment-specific issues. We will also use the OneBox phase to identify any features that rely on external connectivity and plan alternatives or mitigations for SAW/NC (e.g. using **local caches or internal endpoints** if the extension normally calls an external service).
    
-   **Security & Compliance on SAW:** The extension must meet SAW’s strict security requirements. *Dependency:* All components (code, libraries, AI integration) need approval. For instance, if the extension uses an internal AI assistant (the “Bluebird” Copilot service), that service must be onboarded to SAW and compliant with data handling policies. Additionally, the extension will be delivered via a **Software Center** or similar mechanism, which requires packaging and code signing. *Mitigation:* Start the SAW compliance review process early (targeting completion by April). Engage with the SAW team to ensure any needed exceptions or configurations (like allowing the extension’s processes to run or enabling a local service for Copilot suggestions) are in place. As of early 2026, Bluebird’s SAW deployment was on track; if it’s not ready by release time, the extension’s AI features will be toggled off on SAW as a short-term workaround to avoid delays. We will also perform a **threat model and privacy review** of the extension (which is something the Livesite Tools team started doing for their tools) to make sure handling of any sensitive incident data is secure. [\[SQL SRE \[K...ester Plan | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/sqlsre/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3C2A1BB0-D8EF-4564-B6C3-240A0E5819FB%7D&file=SQL%20SRE%20[Kr]%20Tooling%20Semester%20Plan.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    
-   **Tool Performance & Reliability:** There is a risk that running XTS within VS Code (with additional layers like Node.js or the VS Code extension host) could introduce performance overhead or instability. Past internal tests indicated that the XTS CLI, when running complex queries or loading many views, could consume significant memory on SAW. *Mitigation:* Optimize the extension by using lightweight service calls instead of heavy local processes. For example, rather than spinning up the entire XTS Windows Forms UI hidden in the background, the extension uses direct calls to XTS backend services or the **CMS/Kusto APIs**, which is far more efficient. The OneBox testing phase will include stress-testing typical scenarios (large view loads, multiple concurrent queries) to assess performance. If needed, we’ll set specific guidelines (e.g., recommending closing other memory-intensive apps while using the extension on lower-spec machines) and work on performance fixes (like lazy loading components, freeing memory after use, etc.). We will define clear rollback criteria as well – if the extension at any point is found to significantly hinder incident response (e.g., slows down a DRI’s workflow), we are prepared to pull back that update (using the blacklisting mechanism in tool auto-update scripts) until it’s fixed.
    
-   **User Adoption & Change Management:** Introducing a new tool carries the risk that users (on-call engineers) might resist the change, especially if they are under pressure during incidents. *Risk:* DRIs might stick to known tools (legacy XTS, etc.) if the extension is perceived as complicated or missing features. *Mitigation:* Strong **communication, training, and support** will accompany the rollout (detailed in the plan below). We’ll highlight the benefits (like consolidating multiple tools into VS Code, faster workflows, future Copilot assistance) to motivate users. Importantly, the rollout is **gradual and opt-in at first**: even after the extension is available on SAW, DRIs can choose when to adopt it. Both tools will run in parallel initially, so engineers have a safety net of the familiar tools. We will identify **champion users** from the pilot (or early adopters) who can evangelize the extension’s advantages and help peers get onboarded comfortably. Their testimonials and tips can be shared in newsletters or team meetings to build confidence. Only once the extension proves itself (by user feedback and performance) will leadership consider mandating it or retiring the old tools, ensuring the pace of change matches the team’s comfort.
    
-   **Deployment to NC/AGC Constraints:** National Clouds and Air-Gapped Clouds often have unique constraints: no internet access, different authentication models, and slower update cycles. *Dependency:* The extension must be packaged for offline use and possibly undergo separate security reviews for those environments. *Mitigation:* Use existing **deployment pipelines** for Livesite tools in NC/AGC – e.g., the **sqloneclick** installer and DSConsole update mechanisms have been extended to handle NC/AGC by pulling from internal storage accounts. We will integrate the VS Code extension into the same process, meaning when we release a new version, the NC/AGC automation will pick it up. We’ll test installation and functionality on NC/AGC with help from our contacts in those teams (as mentioned, e.g., the AGC support contact Justin Pham will validate in the AGC environment). If certain features cannot function in those clouds (for example, if even our internal Copilot service is not allowed in AGC), we will provide fallbacks or simply document that those features are unavailable in that environment. Ensuring “parity” doesn’t necessarily mean every feature is active everywhere (some AI features might be cloud-specific), but the core incident diagnostics and repair capabilities of XTS will be fully available in NC/AGC through the extension, matching the parity commitments of the Livesite Tools improvement plan.
    
-   **Timeline Risks & Contingencies:** Lastly, timing is a consideration. The plan assumes certain readiness (OneBox testing wraps by end of March, no show-stopper issues; SAW deployment by May, NC/AGC in H2). Delays could occur if, for example, the OneBox phase exposes major rework needs, or a security review on SAW takes longer. *Mitigation:* Build in a little slack in the schedule by planning the SAW release for late May (if things go well it could even be earlier). Maintain close coordination with security and SAW teams to pre-empt any compliance holdups by addressing them early. If OneBox testing indicates the extension isn’t ready, we are prepared to extend that phase or run additional cycles until we are confident (better to delay than to push an unstable tool to SAW). The phased rollout inherently provides go/no-go decision points: we will not proceed to the next phase unless exit criteria of the current phase are met. And if a later phase uncovers issues (for instance, something unexpected in NC), we can pause and fix before continuing. Having a clear **rollback plan** at each stage (as mentioned, ability to revert to older versions or keep old tools available) is part of our risk management.
    

## Lessons from Similar SQL Org Rollouts

Looking at other internal product rollouts in the SQL organization (especially tooling and extensions), several **best practices and lessons** emerge that inform our plan:

-   **Pilot in a Controlled Environment:** As noted, phased rollout is a recurring theme. For instance, during the adoption of a new on-call platform (Cloud SAW/MPD), the team ran a **Phase 1 validation with ~250 users** in parallel to existing tools, to ensure zero production risk. Similarly, the Livesite Tools group often does MVP or early-adopter evaluations for new tools or major updates, such as introducing the **DRI Workbench preview** to a small user set before wider release. We leverage this by using OneBox (and a subset of friendly testers) to vet the extension early, and possibly an **early adopter group on SAW** prior to full enterprise push. This controlled introduction helps **build confidence**; testers who see value will become advocates for the tool when it goes broad.
    
-   **Strong Stakeholder Support:** Rollouts tend to go smoother when leadership is actively involved in messaging and support. In SQL SRE, leaders like Jack Li and Anuradha Jha have been deeply engaged in modernization initiatives, frequently communicating vision and progress. For our extension, we have that buy-in (as it aligns with the “One Tool” DRI Workbench vision). We will keep stakeholders updated at key milestones and enlist them to champion the effort in org-wide communications. Their endorsement adds credibility (“this is important and we’re investing in it”) and can encourage teams to try the new tool. Also, involving stakeholders ensures we align the rollout with broader schedules (for example, avoiding conflict with a major incident drill or a freeze period).
    
-   **Comprehensive Communication Plan:** Other rollouts put heavy emphasis on communication artifacts. The **SQL SRE newsletters** regularly announce new tool features and status updates. The MPD onboarding had a well-documented EngHub page with known issues and installation steps, plus Teams channels for discussion. We should prepare a communication kit including:
    
    -   A **detailed announcement email** (and Teams posts) around each phase, especially for the SAW and NC/AGC releases. These announcements should spell out *what the extension is, why it’s beneficial, when and how to get it*, and where to find help. It should also clarify that OneBox is a test phase (for awareness) and that the SAW release in May is the initial “preview” for broad use.
    -   **User guides and documentation:** Update the internal wiki/EngHub with an overview of the VS Code extension, installation instructions on each environment (OneBox, SAW, NC, AGC), and how to perform common tasks in it. Leverage the existing docs structure for Livesite Tools; e.g., add a section under “SQL Livesite Tools on SAW” about the extension usage. If possible, include short demo videos or screenshots to help users get started.
    -   **Training sessions:** Host a live demo (or recorded video) when launching on SAW, walking through real-world use cases: e.g., triaging an incident using the VS Code extension vs. the old way. In the MPD rollout, they did brown-bag sessions and recorded them for later viewing—we can do similar. Additionally, incorporate the extension into the regular **on-call training curriculum** for new DRIs once it’s officially released.
-   **Dedicated Support Channels:** A notable best practice from prior internal rollouts is establishing clear support mechanisms. The tooling team often maintains a **Teams channel for support** (for example, a “SQL Tools & SAW Office Hour” channel was created with hundreds of members, facilitating Q&A). We will use the existing “SQL Livesite Tools” channel or create a focused channel for the extension where users can report issues or ask questions and get quick responses from the dev team. Moreover, scheduling periodic **“office hours”** (perhaps twice a week during the first month of SAW release) provides a forum for live troubleshooting and feedback. Ensuring support staff or the dev team is readily available at launch can prevent frustrated users from abandoning the tool at the first sign of trouble. Also, as done previously, we’ll prepare **Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs)** for known issues (e.g., “If the extension fails to connect to XTS, try X, Y, Z”) and share those in documentation and pinned posts.
    
-   **Iterative Improvement & Responsiveness:** Successful product rollouts treat the release as a **beginning, not an end**. The Livesite Tools team’s shift to a faster release cycle means they can incorporate feedback quickly. In one case, after a major tools update, the team quickly fixed a regression that was discovered, minimizing user impact. We must be similarly responsive: monitor telemetry and feedback closely after each phase, and be ready to issue patches. If we show users that their feedback leads to rapid improvements (for example, an issue raised during the SAW launch is fixed in a patch the next week), they’ll be more willing to stick with the new tool. It’s also wise to plan for a **“post-mortem” review** after each phase – what went well, what didn’t – and apply lessons to the next phase. Given this is an internal tool, we have the advantage of direct access to our users (who are colleagues); we can survey them or even interview some to gather qualitative insights for improvements.
    
-   **Precedents to Learn From:** We have several relevant rollouts to draw inspiration:
    
    -   *XTS & Livesite Tools releases:* The quarterly (now monthly) tool releases have a well-defined process including smoke tests on OneBox/DevBox and SAW, coordination with partner teams (OneBox team, AGC team) before release, and communications to those teams about upcoming changes. This underscores the importance of cross-team coordination. Before our SAW release, we will notify partner teams (OneBox team, AGC support team, etc.) as outlined in that process, to ensure they are prepared and available for any needed validations or support.
    -   *MPD (Cloud SAW) Transition:* This was a major change for all engineers, and it was broken into stages (Cohorts, Phase 1 and Phase 2) with clear *go/no-go* decision points and fallback options (users kept existing SAW access during testing). We can mirror that by allowing DRIs to revert to the old method during an initial “testing period” of our VS Code extension. Additionally, MPD transition taught teams to address *perception*: many were worried about performance and connectivity in Cloud SAW, so the team provided data (page views, known issues) and reassured users via constant updates. For our extension, we might collect some success stats post-pilot and share them (e.g., “In our pilot, 85% of common tasks were completed in the VS Code extension without needing the old tools, and 90% of participants wanted to keep using it”). Such figures can motivate others – we could include a few early testimonials in the communications as well.
    -   *DRI Workbench Preview:* The ongoing “One Tool – DRI Workbench” effort, which parallels our extension’s goals, had phases like user testing with MVPs and a **private preview (PrPr)** stage planned. The idea of a private preview (limited to invited users) before public preview (open to all internal users) is something we might consider for the SAW phase. If time permits, doing a short private preview with a handful of users from each major region could ensure any last bugs are fixed. The DRI Workbench effort also emphasized solving top pain points and not introducing “yet another tool” without clear value. We should be mindful to position the VS Code extension as *the* evolution of XTS (and related tools), not just an additional optional tool. That means, over time, consolidating functionality and guiding users towards it as the primary interface.

In summary, these lessons underscore the importance of a careful rollout: start small, communicate a lot, support the users, and iterate. Now, leveraging those insights, we can outline a concrete plan.

## Comprehensive Rollout Plan

Below is the proposed rollout plan, broken into phases with key activities, responsibilities, and timelines:

| **Phase & Timeline** | **Key Activities & Milestones** | **Key Owners / Resources** | **Status & Timing** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1: OneBox Dev/Test**  
*(Feb–Mar 2026)* | \- **Deploy extension to OneBox** environment for **internal testing**.  
\- Engineers run through **diagnostic & repair scenarios** (XTS views, Kusto queries, CAS commands) on test clusters to validate functionality [\[Onebox and...inner loop | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SQLOneBox/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9CE80B23-98E5-4813-B1EA-E25D15CE0637%7D&file=Onebox%20and%20Livesite%20Tools%20for%20developer%20inner%20loop.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).  
\- Gather feedback on bugs, integration issues (especially differences vs. SAW).  
\- Address critical defects and iterate rapidly.  
\- **Exit Criteria:** Extension supports key XTS features reliably in OneBox, no showstopper bugs remain, and differences between OneBox and SAW are documented with solutions in progress. | **XTS Dev Team** (Cristián Ormazábal Ortega & team) – deploy & fix issues.  
**Test Engineers** (Tooling team members, possibly OneBox team) – execute test cases (per predefined smoke tests for XTS/SFE/DSC on OneBox) [\[Onebox and...inner loop | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SQLOneBox/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9CE80B23-98E5-4813-B1EA-E25D15CE0637%7D&file=Onebox%20and%20Livesite%20Tools%20for%20developer%20inner%20loop.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).  
**Product Manager (PM)** – coordinate feedback collection and triage issues. | *Planned/In Progress:* Development builds already running in OneBox; formal test phase runs through Feb–Mar 2026. |
| **Phase 2: SAW Release (Preview)**  
*(Apr–May 2026)* | \- Complete **security reviews and signing** for SAW compliance.  
\- Package extension (likely as signed VSIX or MSI) and publish to **SAW Software Center** (or alternative approved distribution).  
\- Possibly conduct a short **private preview** on SAW (Apr) with a small group of power users to validate installation & performance on real incidents.  
\- **Organization-wide announcement** of the extension’s availability on SAW in early May: highlight features, how to install, and where to get support.  
\- Provide **training**: live demo sessions, updated EngHub documentation, quick-start guides. Ensure **support channels** are in place (Teams channel, office hours).  
\- **Monitor adoption and issues** closely: use telemetry and direct feedback during initial weeks. Quickly address any high-severity bugs with patches.  
\- **Exit Criteria:** >50% of targeted users have installed the extension by end of first month; no unresolved Sev1/Sev2 issues; positive feedback from key stakeholders and users, indicating readiness for broader cloud rollout. | **Tooling Dev/PM Team** – finalize build & deployment process, run last-minute tests.  
**SAW Operations/IT** – assist with distribution to all SAW users (ensure the package meets requirements).  
**SRE Leadership** – send endorsement message (e.g., Jack Li supporting the rollout in the SRE newsletter).  
**Comms Lead (e.g. PM)** – Send announcements; maintain docs.  
**Support Champions** – Pilot users and experts staffing Q&A and collecting feedback. | *Target:* Release by **May 2026**.  
Private preview (early Apr) if needed; full release to all SAW users by end of May 2026. |
| **Phase 3: NC & AGC Rollout**  
*(Q3–Q4 2026)* | \- **Adapt and package** the extension for **sovereign clouds**:  
  • Remove or modify features unsupported offline (e.g. external AI calls).  
  • Ensure authentication works with NC/AGC tenants and endpoints.  
\- Work with **OneBox/DSConsole team** to include the extension in the next NC/AGC tools release package (using the established **OneClick installer** or update scripts).  
\- Coordinate a **pilot in NC** (Mooncake/Fairfax) with a small set of users to validate installation and function. Do the same for AGC via the **AGC support team**.  
\- Resolve any cloud-specific issues (e.g., different compliance settings, network access to XTS data sources).  
\- **Deploy to NC and AGC** environments in a staged manner (perhaps NC first, then AGC). Announce to NC/AGC user groups with tailored instructions (via their mailing lists or site leads).  
\- Verify parity: all critical workflows (diagnose and repair in incidents) work in these clouds as they did on SAW.  
\- **Exit Criteria:** Extension is available and functional in all targeted environments; no major gaps in NC/AGC versus public cloud usage (aside from known limitations communicated to users). | **Tooling Dev Team** – implement code adjustments for NC/AGC (e.g., config changes for endpoints).  
**DSConsole Release Manager** – include extension in sovereign cloud distribution scripts.  
**NC/AGC Cloud Teams** – schedule and execute the deployment (in sync with their maintenance windows).  
**Testers (NC/AGC)** – local cloud support engineers or designated testers (e.g., Justin Pham for AGC) validate the extension in those environments. | *Planned:* **Q3 2026** – package ready for NC/AGC.  
Pilot testing in Q3; targeted full rollout by **Q4 2026** (could vary by cloud, aiming for completion by end of 2026). |
| **Phase 4: Continuous Improvement**  
*(Post-release, 2026–2027)* | \- **Monitor & support:** Track usage, tool performance, and incident outcomes (MTTR, number of incidents handled using the extension). Maintain support channels for questions and issue reporting.  
\- **Feedback loop:** Send out user satisfaction surveys and gather suggestions. Also utilize existing **Spring/Fall SRE tool surveys** to gauge improvement (the tooling survey scores significantly rose from ~30% to ~67% “Good or better” from 2022 to 2024 with focused improvements – we aim to continue that trajectory).  
\- **Regular updates:** Move to a **monthly release cadence** for the extension, in line with the broader Tools release cycle. Each release will include bug fixes and often a few enhancements (e.g., performance optimizations, new features like integrated SFE view, etc.). Use internal release notes to keep users informed of changes.  
\- **Training & onboarding:** Update on-call training materials to include the extension as the primary tool for new DRIs. Retire outdated documentation of legacy XTS as appropriate.  
\- **Evaluate deprecation of legacy tools:** Once the extension achieves high adoption (e.g., >90% of DRIs regularly using it) and all critical features are confirmed, work with leadership to schedule the phase-out of the old XTS and related tools. This would involve an announcement of EOL (with advance notice), ensuring any remaining gaps (perhaps advanced edge-case features) are addressed or have alternatives. This final step is beyond 2026, but planning can start once we have a few months of data from the NC/AGC rollout. | **Product/Engineering Team** – own the update pipeline, bug fixes, feature development (e.g. Jonathan Bullkich, Justin Kavalan contributing new features according to modernization roadmap).  
**Support/UX** – continue to gather feedback (PMs like Megha Devaraj to run surveys, interviews).  
**SRE Leadership** – periodically review adoption metrics and decide on legacy tool retirement timing.  
**All DRIs** – provide feedback and champion the tool in daily use, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement. | *Ongoing:* After each phase, immediately start feedback collection and improvements.  
Major review at **1-2 months post-SAW release** (summer 2026) to verify if we’re ready for NC/AGC phase.  
Another review at end of 2026 to assess overall success and plan next steps (e.g., legacy tool deprecation in 2027). |

### Communication & Training Highlights

To ensure a successful rollout, a parallel **communication plan** will be in effect:

-   A kickoff introduction of the VS Code extension will appear in the **SQL SRE Q1/Q2 2026 newsletter** (written by the PM or sponsor) to set context.
-   Before the SAW release, we’ll send a detailed **tutorial email** (possibly from Anuradha Jha or the dev team) explaining how to install the extension via Software Center and listing key commands and shortcuts it provides. This email doubles as documentation for busy engineers who might not read a full wiki page.
-   The **EngHub documentation** for SQL Livesite Tools will be updated concurrently, including a new section specifically for the VS Code extension (covering OneBox usage, SAW installation, troubleshooting, and NC/AGC notes).
-   We’ll host a **Live Demo Meeting** shortly after the SAW launch (and record it), walking through a real incident scenario using the extension. Participants can ask questions live; the recording will be shared for those who couldn’t attend.
-   In the **Teams support channel**, we will pin a message with FAQs (e.g., “What to do if XTS view doesn’t load in the extension?”) and link to the documentation. We expect common questions especially around initial setup on SAW, so we will prepare answers based on pilot experience.
-   For NC/AGC, since the user base might be smaller or separate, we’ll work with the respective support leads to communicate through their channels. Possibly a targeted email or a mention in their team meetings to alert them when the extension is coming, with any cloud-specific instructions (like “download the offline installer from X location” if applicable).

Each phase’s communication will emphasize that we welcome feedback. We’ll include a direct link to a **feedback form or survey** in the announcement (as well as encourage posting in Teams). This shows users that their input is valued and will help shape the tool – which can increase engagement.

Finally, throughout the rollout, we maintain alignment with our vision: providing a unified, efficient incident management experience. By following a careful phase-wise plan, incorporating lessons from past rollouts, and keeping users in the loop, we increase the chances that this new VS Code extension will be not only adopted, but embraced, by the SQL on-call community across all environments. The end result will be a modernized workflow where engineers can handle incidents faster and with less context-switching, fulfilling the North Star of a “single pane of glass” for SQL livesite support – first within OneBox and SAW, and soon for every cloud environment we operate in.
