# **📅 sync – SDD for SRE**

## **Feb 3, 2026, 2:35–3:00 PM – Teams Video Call**

*Follow-up on SRE’s Spec-Driven Development (SDD) adoption initiative, covering the SDD roll-out plan, leadership feedback, GitHub Copilot platform integration, and use of Spec Kit in upcoming planning.*

# **🧭 Meeting Overview**

🚀 **SDD adoption is underway** – Initial Spec Kit onboarding in progress, with a draft proposal nearly ready for SRE leadership review

-   **Progress**: Three key repositories (AzureSqlTools, SqlDriWorkbench, Engsys-Ads-Partner) have Spec Kit onboarding pull requests issued. Joo compiled an **SDD Overview wiki** page listing these repos and their onboarding status. [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535)
-   **Next Step**: A proposal for SDD adoption is being prepared to present to the SRE leadership team next week. This proposal will summarize the plan and status of onboarding and will be driven by you and Joo. [\[SRE AI Innovation | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:KnJ0z8EGkNx49Ecw6Tg6phnW4XqGfZb6nDv4Bgeghss1@thread.tacv2/1770083542514?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=6800070b-8136-4c8f-9512-d40a7e5b4fd2&parentMessageId=1769798059450&teamName=SRE%20AI%20Innovation&channelName=General&createdTime=1770083542514)
-   **Your Input**: You’ve been populating a “SpecKit” inventory tab with tooling team repos (e.g. listing projects and spec adoption status). This work fed into Joo’s wiki tables, ensuring leadership sees concrete progress. Continue updating any missing repos before the proposal is finalized. [\[SRE AI Innovation | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:KnJ0z8EGkNx49Ecw6Tg6phnW4XqGfZb6nDv4Bgeghss1@thread.tacv2/1770083542514?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=6800070b-8136-4c8f-9512-d40a7e5b4fd2&parentMessageId=1769798059450&teamName=SRE%20AI%20Innovation&channelName=General&createdTime=1770083542514)
-   **Open Question**: For the **SQLSRE monorepo**, which contains multiple heterogeneous projects, Joo noted we may need separate project-level Spec Kit setups. Deciding on **repo-level vs project-level** Spec Kit implementation is still pending – this detail might need addressing in the proposal or in discussion (to avoid confusion when leadership reviews the plan). [\[Tooling - Spec Kit | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:f30594c726524173b47063453ab603b5@thread.tacv2/1769568961776?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1769548907374&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=Tooling%20-%20Spec%20Kit&createdTime=1769568961776)

💡 **Spec Kit gaining traction** – SRE leadership encourages broad use (even for tooling), and a team knowledge-sharing session is planned

-   **Leadership Ask**: There was a recent ask from SRE leadership to **use Spec Kit for developing our troubleshooting tools and other projects**, not just for code features. This means SDD isn’t limited to product code – it’s being seen as a way to build internal solutions (e.g. automating runbooks or tools). [\[SODA | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:dd0f63268fc245c794b18748257d3a4d@thread.tacv2/1768609131756?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1768609131756&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=SODA&createdTime=1768609131756)
-   **Success so far**: Joo experimented with Spec Kit to build a new VS Code extension for the team, showing it’s viable for our tooling. He even generated an “on-call scheduler” utility via Spec Kit as a proof-of-concept. These successes are boosting confidence in SDD’s value. [\[SODA | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:dd0f63268fc245c794b18748257d3a4d@thread.tacv2/1768609131756?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1768609131756&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=SODA&createdTime=1768609131756)Re: need a volunteer to look into Spec Kit
-   **Knowledge Share**: Joo has scheduled a tech talk (moved to next Tuesday) for the team to **demonstrate Spec Kit** and share learnings. This will help get everyone (including possibly PMs and other engineers) up to speed on spec-driven workflows. You might be asked to contribute or answer questions during this session, given your hands-on experience (e.g. your recent Spec Kit demo in the SODA forum showed the workflow and benefits). [\[SODA | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:dd0f63268fc245c794b18748257d3a4d@thread.tacv2/1768609131756?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1768609131756&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=SODA&createdTime=1768609131756) [\[Spec-kit session | Loop\]](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnQtbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvamJ1bGxraWNoX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1waWRXeHNhMmxqYUNVMVJtMXBZM0p2YzI5bWRDVTFSbU52YlNaa1BXSWxNakUxSlRWR05FOXZZMkZKYm10SGFqRnRUV2xpZW5saUpUSkVPRWN5VjFFMVUwVnZOVTV0VVhoNE9XZGtVeVV5UkRseEpUVkdiaVV5UkdGWlFXRnJZMVEyWTFjeGN6ZzNKVFZHTVZaakptWTlNREZUUTA0elZGcFFSMVJEVHpSVFZWRlVTbFpETTAweVZqUkpWa3BPVmxsUU55WmpQU1V5UmcifQ%3D%3D)

🔎 **New SRE LT input** – Leadership wants SDD tied into our planning process, raising questions about PM involvement and spec maintenance

-   **“SDD in Planning”**: In a recent SRE LT meeting, management inquired how Spec-Driven Development can be integrated into **semester planning**. They want to see if product managers and engineers can collaborate on specs during planning, so that execution (coding) flows directly from those specs. This is now an open design issue for our team. [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535)
-   **Implication**: We may need to adjust our planning rituals. For example, when defining H1 2026 objectives, the team could draft high-level specs instead of traditional design docs. This would ensure development (with Spec Kit) aligns with what was planned. However, it requires bringing PMs on board with writing or reviewing specs.
-   **Discussion Points**: Expect to brainstorm how this could work. Key considerations include: how to involve PMs (training them on spec format?), how to keep specs “alive” and updated if plans change, and what tooling support is needed so specs remain sync’d with code over the semester. This conversation will likely be exploratory; you should be ready to offer ideas or examples (perhaps citing how other teams approach “Docs as Code” or using spec templates in planning). [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535)

🤖 **Custom Copilot agent needed** – Plan to create a GitHub Copilot (GHCP) *custom agent* with SRE-specific skills to leverage our specs and guides

-   **Why it matters**: The SDD rollout isn’t just about generating code – it’s also about operationalizing those specs. A custom **GHCP agent** (Copilot Chat agent) can use our SRE domain knowledge (spec documents, TSGs) to assist in tasks like troubleshooting or code generation. In the SDD adoption wiki, “GHCP Custom Agent and Skill” is listed as a dependency, highlighting it as a needed component for full adoption. [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535)
-   **Vision**: The long-term goal (as discussed in a recent deep-dive) is to **convert our Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs) and other know-how into shareable agents/skills**. This would mean the Copilot agent can reference up-to-date specs or runbooks when helping engineers – effectively automating part of the SRE workflow. For example, an SRE Copilot agent could answer “Does this service have an SDD spec? What are its known failure modes?” by reading the spec and related docs. [\[Deep Dive-...+ Telemetr | External\]](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cristiano_microsoft_com/Documents/Meetings/Deep Dive- SRE DRI copilot agentsLivesite tooling + Telemetr.loop)
-   **Status**: We need to define what our custom agent should do and begin authoring it. GitHub provides a way to create custom agent profiles (.agent.md files with YAML frontmatter) to specify an agent’s tools, context, and behavior. We’ll likely give it tools to query our internal knowledge (e.g., search our spec repository, run certain automation). So far, Jack Li’s Copilot Labs and guidance might be our starting point – Anuradha already prototyped a “CAS” agent for common commands. [\[docs.github.com\]](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-custom-agents) [\[Re: copilo...real issue | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADZkMzYzNzkzLTQwZjItNDEzMC04MjMxLTc5MWY3ODEzMGJmZgBGAAAAAABEixQZuPpZQp2HuhHIrosNBwA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAAAAAAEMAAA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAAQPBaxHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
-   **Next Steps**: In the meeting, clarify the scope of this agent. For instance, should it primarily help with **incident management** (using TSGs), or also assist in **spec writing/validation**? Pinning down the use cases will guide how you author the agent’s instructions. Also, discuss if we have support from the Copilot team: Andrew Chung hinted that Spec Kit’s functionality might merge into GHCP soon, so aligning with GHCP’s roadmap could be strategic.

# **🎯 Desired Outcome and Top Priorities**

-   **Finalize SDD Adoption Plan**
    
    -   The group should reach agreement that the **SDD onboarding proposal** (repos status, owners, timeline) is complete and ready for leadership. Ensure any remaining repositories or open questions (like multi-project setup) are acknowledged with an action plan. [\[Tooling - Spec Kit | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:f30594c726524173b47063453ab603b5@thread.tacv2/1769568961776?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1769548907374&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=Tooling%20-%20Spec%20Kit&createdTime=1769568961776)
-   **Align on GHCP Agent Strategy**
    
    -   Clearly define the **objectives and next steps** for the GHCP custom agent. For example, decide on the agent’s primary use cases (troubleshooting? spec QA?), and identify who will draft its profile. A target outcome is a rough plan or owners for creating the agent skill so this doesn’t remain a vague “to-do.”
-   **Address Leadership “Planning” Ask**
    
    -   Come away with a concrete idea (or at least an approach) for **integrating SDD into the upcoming planning cycle**. This could mean scheduling a separate workshop with PMs, or deciding to pilot spec-driven planning on one project. The priority is that you have something to tell SRE LT about how this will be handled (even if the full solution will be iterative). [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535)
-   **Mitigate Open Issues**
    
    -   For each open issue noted on the SDD wiki (planning process, repo vs project spec setup, keeping specs updated), ensure there’s either an answer or a follow-up action. The meeting should identify owners or follow-ups (e.g., “we will evaluate project-level Spec Kit by trying it in SQLSRE repo”) so that these concerns are actively managed and don’t block adoption.

# **💬 Likely Agenda & Discussion Points**

Below is a breakdown of each agenda item with key context and potential contributions you can make:

| **Agenda Topic** | **Key Talking Points & Context** | **Suggested Questions / Observations** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. SDD – Overview** | *Status check:* 3 pilot repos have SpecKit onboarding PRs (in progress) [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535); a draft **SDD adoption wiki** with status tables is available [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535). The proposal to SRE LT is due next week [\[SRE AI Innovation | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:KnJ0z8EGkNx49Ecw6Tg6phnW4XqGfZb6nDv4Bgeghss1@thread.tacv2/1770083542514?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=6800070b-8136-4c8f-9512-d40a7e5b4fd2&parentMessageId=1769798059450&teamName=SRE%20AI%20Innovation&channelName=General&createdTime=1770083542514). Ensure completeness (e.g., did we include all relevant repos?). Also note unresolved implementation details like **monorepo handling** (multiple projects in one repo) [\[Tooling - Spec Kit | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:f30594c726524173b47063453ab603b5@thread.tacv2/1769568961776?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1769548907374&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=Tooling%20-%20Spec%20Kit&createdTime=1769568961776). | **“Have we covered all codebases in our SDD plan?”** (E.g. *“Do we need to include the SQLSRE or LivesiteAgents repos in this first wave of onboarding, or are we focusing only on tooling repos for now?”* [\[Tooling - Spec Kit | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:f30594c726524173b47063453ab603b5@thread.tacv2/1769568961776?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&groupId=34f73fbd-1a9a-4dcc-a0dd-ffd508cd3dca&parentMessageId=1769548907374&teamName=SQL%20SRE%20Core&channelName=Tooling%20-%20Spec%20Kit&createdTime=1769568961776)) This shows foresight in covering scope.  
**“Should we address the specKit setup for multi-project repos in the proposal?”** (Acknowledging the project-level vs repo-level question – demonstrates you’re anticipating technical questions.) |
| **2\. Asks from SRE LT** | *Leadership feedback:* SRE LT wants to see how SDD will integrate with **existing processes**. Key ask: incorporate SDD into **planning cycles** (so specs are part of quarterly/semester planning) [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535). They may also be looking for clarity on any risks or support needed (so be ready to mention if we need additional resources or tools). | **“To address leadership’s planning question, should we propose a pilot in the upcoming planning session?”** (e.g. *“Perhaps we could pilot spec-driven planning for one project next semester to show how PMs and devs collaborate on a spec-first approach?”* This offers a proactive solution.)  
**“Do we need leadership buy-in for any tooling or training (for PMs or devs)?”** (Shows that you’re considering what support to ask from LT when you present the proposal.) |
| **3\. GHCP Custom Agent & Skill** | *Next-gen tooling:* The team plans to develop a **GitHub Copilot custom agent** tailored for SRE. This agent could use our specs and Troubleshooting Guides to assist in coding and incident management [\[Deep Dive-...+ Telemetr | External\]](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/personal/cristiano_microsoft_com/Documents/Meetings/Deep Dive- SRE DRI copilot agentsLivesite tooling + Telemetr.loop). It’s currently a blank slate (no profile yet), and it’s noted as a dependency for SDD rollout [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535). We have internal Copilot labs and examples (e.g., CAS command agent) to draw from [\[Re: copilo...real issue | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADZkMzYzNzkzLTQwZjItNDEzMC04MjMxLTc5MWY3ODEzMGJmZgBGAAAAAABEixQZuPpZQp2HuhHIrosNBwA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAAAAAAEMAAA1n%2fEc464BT4zgV%2bf7A7ddAAQPBaxHAAA%3d&exvsurl=1&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem), but need to define scope. | **“Which specific capabilities do we want our custom Copilot agent to have?”** (For instance: *“Should it focus on incident troubleshooting using our spec & TSG knowledge, or also help engineers author new specs with best practices?”* This clarifies requirements.)  
**“Do we have guidance or contacts from the Copilot team for building this?”** (e.g. *“It might help if we check with the Copilot group about best practices for custom agents – should I reach out to them or follow the official docs?”* [\[Deep Dive-...ry Copilot | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_YzU5ZTU1MDgtODZhNS00MWU0LWFkNDgtOWVmMTcxMzNlNDk4@thread.v2/1768579442296?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D). This shows initiative in seeking support.) |
| **4\. Semester Planning w/ Spec Kit** | *Process innovation:* How to apply SDD in the planning phase. Possibly involve PMs in writing initial specs for projects (so specs are ready for dev). This addresses the LT’s question directly [\[SDD (Spec-...velopment) | ADO Wiki (MSData)\]](https://msdata.visualstudio.com/Database%20Systems/_wiki/wikis/Database%20Systems.wiki/119535). Challenges: PMs may need guidance, and we must keep these specs updated as plans adjust. The discussion will likely explore ideas (e.g., using Spec Kit to flesh out requirements or auto-generate portions of planning docs). | **“Should we involve product managers early by co-writing specs for upcoming projects?”** (For example: *“Perhaps for the next semester plan, we can pick a feature and have the PM and an engineer draft the spec together using Spec Kit templates. Is that something we want to try?”* This demonstrates a concrete idea to bridge teams.)  
**“How do we ensure specs from planning stay up-to-date?”** (e.g. *“If we create specs during planning, do we have a process to revise them when requirements change?
